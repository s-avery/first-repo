    <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too
        small to
        get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans
        think is
        impossible.</p>

        It's impressive,
        don't you think?
        Vampire bats weigh
        almost nothing,
        but they can down a creature
        nearly ten times their size.</p>
